# Breast-cancer-classification
This deep learning model classifies the type of cancer based on the features of the tumor.
It classifies whether the patient has benign tumor or malignant.
The dataset used is easily available on Kaggle.
Initially, I used sequential model with an input size of 30 neurons and relu activation function.
Further to avoid overfitting, I added dropout layers and used the callback function.
After testing with the test data, I obtained an accuracy of 99%.
